                <h1>About us</h1>
                As Vietnam’s educational culture was sparked by Chinese influence, the roots of education come from the country’s belief in Confucianism (Mongabay, 1987). Confucius taught that man is at the center of the universe, but that man cannot be alone; he finds happiness in community with others. He also taught the belief that everyone has the same potential to be educated, and therefore education should be available to everyone. Vietnam was therefore constructed to be a collectivist country, meaning that individuals are less important than the whole (Yee, 2002). Community is extremely important, so education is seen as a way to create a community of good citizens instead of a way for one to advance personally.

The Vietnamese believe that One of the traditional values of the Vietnamese people is the promotion of learning and the respect for teachers. In the Feudal and Colonial periods, teacher’s were seen to have more importance than parents; their position was “only lower than the king” (Worldbank, part 1.paragraph 1, 2010). The report by the WorldBank in 2010 explains that teachers would often be invited to live in the homes of wealthy villagers to teach the family’s children as well as other children in the village. To become a teacher, the mandarins requested that candidates have excellent learning achievements and have high marks in competitive exams. The first exam was conducted in 1075, and the first Confucian university was constructed in 1070, called the Temple of Literature. For about one thousand years, the Vietnamese people learned Chinese characters and used them to write but pronounced them in a Vietnamese way. This was done in order to preserve a certain national independence from the Chinese.

                French Colonization(late 19th- mid-20th century):

As indicated in the 2010 WorldBank report, the French colonized Vietnam in the late 19th century. With this change in power, the Confucian-oreiented education that had been built and maintained by the Vietnamese was replaced with French-Vietnamese education, with the goal of training people to serve the colonial system. The French built elementary schools, primary schools, primary colleges, secondary schools, and three universities, all with French as the dominant language of instruction. However there were not very many schools built, so there was extremely limited access to

education during this period in Vietnam’s history. “With such an education system, 95% of Vietnamese people were illiterate” (WorldBank, part 1. paragraph 6, 2010). Growing frustration led to the country’s independence in the mid-20th century.

Independence to Reunification (1945-1975):

On September 2, 1945, Vietname gained independence from France. President Ho Chi Minh decided that the three key priorities of the new, independent government would be “fighting against poverty, illiteracy, and invaders” (WorldBank, part 1. paragraph 7, 2010). His new driving philosophy for education was “an illiterate nation is a powerless one” and, in October 1945,  he issues a “Call for anti-illiteracy” (WorldBank, part 1. paragraph 8, 2010).

The president’s call was a success: within one year 75 thousand literacy classes were established with about 96 thousand teachers to help 2.5 million people learn to read and write.

During the years of resistance (1946-1954), schools operated in demilitarized areas. They stopped teaching in French and created curriculum in Vietnamese. The government passed an education reform in 1950 with the goal of reducing the years of general education and concentrating on reading, writing, and calculating skills.
